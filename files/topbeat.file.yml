############################# Input ############################################
input:
 # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
 period: {PERIOD}

 # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
 # By default, all the processes are monitored
 procs: ["{PROCS}"]


############################# Output ##########################################

    # Name of the generated files. The default is `topbeat` and it generates
    # files: `topbeat`, `topbeat.1`, `topbeat.2`, etc.
    #filename: topbeat

    # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, the files are
    # rotated. The default value is 10 MB.
    #rotate_every_kb: 10000

    # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached, the
