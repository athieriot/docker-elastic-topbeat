################### Topbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Input ############################################
input:
 # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
 period: {PERIOD}

 # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
 # By default, all the processes are monitored
 procs: ["{PROCS}"]


############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  ### Logstash as output
  logstash:
    # Uncomment out this option if you want to output to Logstash. The default is false.
    enabled: true

    # The Logstash hosts
    hosts: ["{HOST}:{PORT}"]

    # Optional load balance the events between the Logstash hosts
    #loadbalance: true

    # Optional index name. The default index name is topbeat
    index: {INDEX}

    # Optional TLS. The default is on
    #tls:
      #disabled: true

      # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
      #certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

      # Certificate for TLS client authentication
      #certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

      # Client Certificate Key
      #certificate_key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.
      # If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates will be
      # accepted. In this mode TLS based connections are susceptible to
      # man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing.
      #insecure: true

      # Configure cipher suites to be used for TLS connections
      #cipher_suites: []

      # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
      #curve_types: []


############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  #ignore_outgoing: true


############################# Logging #########################################

#logging:
#  selectors: []

# Rotator config
#    files:
#    path: /var/log/topbeat
