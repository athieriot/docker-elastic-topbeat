################### Topbeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Input ############################################
input:
 # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
 period: {PERIOD}

 # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
 # By default, all the processes are monitored
 procs: ["{PROCS}"]


############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  ### Elasticsearch as output
  elasticsearch:

    # Set to true to enable elasticsearch output
    enabled: true

    # A list of Elasticsearch hosts. If the connection to the first host fails, it connects to the second one.
    # A host can be defined as an IP:PORT or an URL with the format: scheme://IP:PORT/path. In case you specify and
    # additional path, the scheme is required. The defaults are ( port is 9200, path is '/', scheme is http).
    # In case of an IPv6 address, please use http://[2001:db8::1]:9200.
    hosts: ["{HOST}:{PORT}"]

    # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials. These are deprectad
    #protocol: "https"
    #username: "admin"
    #password: "s3cr3t"

    # Optional index name. The default is "topbeat" and generates
    # [topbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD keys.
    index: "{INDEX}"

    # Optional HTTP Path
    #path: "/elasticsearch"

    # The number of times a particular Elasticsearch index operation is attempted. If
    # the indexing operation doesn't succeed after this many retries, the events are
    # dropped. The default is 3.
    #max_retries: 3

    # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Elasticsearch bulk API index request.
    # The default is 10000.
    #bulk_max_size: 10000

    # The number of seconds to wait for new events between two bulk API index requests.
    # If `bulk_max_size` is reached before this interval expires, addition bulk index
    # requests are made.
    #flush_interval

    #The time to live in seconds for the topology information that is stored in
    #Elasticsearch. The default is 15 seconds.

    # tls configuration
    #tls:
      # If disabled is set to true, the tls section will be ignored and the
      # host its certificate authorities will be used.

      # Controls whether the client verifies server certificates and host name.
      # If insecure is set to true, all server host names and certificates will be
      # accepted. In this mode TLS based connections are susceptible to
      # man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing.

############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  name: {SHIPPER}

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
